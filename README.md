#  README – Zombie Survival Inventory (Java BST Project)
##  Zombie Survival Inventory System
##  Description

This project is a Java-based inventory management system designed around a zombie survival scenario. Supplies are stored inside a custom-built Binary Search Tree (BST), allowing efficient insertion, searching, and organized display of items. Each supply includes attributes such as name, type, weight, and survival value.

The system demonstrates how data structures can be used to manage and organize resources efficiently in a themed application.

#  Features

Custom Binary Search Tree implementation using generics

Insert and store survival supplies

Search for items using tree traversal

Inorder traversal to display sorted inventory

Object-oriented design with a custom Supply class

Comparable interface for automatic sorting

##  Concepts Used

Object-Oriented Programming (Classes & Objects)

Generics in Java

Binary Search Trees

Recursion

Comparable Interface

Data Structures & Algorithms

Console Output Formatting

##  Project Structure

BST.java – Generic Binary Search Tree implementation

Supply.java – Supply object with attributes and comparison logic

Main.java – Program execution and inventory simulation

##  What I Learned

Through this project, I practiced building data structures from scratch, implementing comparison logic for sorting objects, and organizing structured data efficiently using tree-based algorithms.
